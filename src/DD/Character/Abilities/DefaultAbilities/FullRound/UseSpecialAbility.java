 * The UseSpecialAbility ability allows the Character to use any special ability the Character has.
 * These special abilities can do many things, and this class should be treated more like a SubAction
 * class than an ability class. The special abilities themselves should be listed by this class.

 * IMPORTANT: This ability is a start/end full round action.
