D&D
This is a Java based game that will use Slick2D for graphics. 
The game will be a take on the Dungeons and Dragons table top game 
(specifically Pathfinder) and will focus on providing players and 
GM's a map to play on, as well as pre-defined enemies. The purpose 
will be to allow for players to play without needing to be in the
same place while storing character progress and minimizing
GM time spent on world management.
